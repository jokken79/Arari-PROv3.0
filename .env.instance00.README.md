# .env.instance00 - DEPRECIATED CONFIGURATION FILE

## ⚠️ STATUS: DEPRECATED

This file was originally used for instance-specific configuration but is **NO LONGER IN USE**.

## History

- **Original Purpose**: Multi-instance deployment configuration
- **Original Port**: 9000 (Backend)
- **Current Port**: 8000 (Unified across all instances)
- **Deprecated Date**: 2025-12-17

## Current Configuration Location

All environment configuration is now centralized in:

```
arari-app/.env.local
```

## Why This File Still Exists

This file is kept for historical reference and backward compatibility. It has been updated to point to the correct port (8000) but should not be used for new deployments.

## Migration Path

If you were using this file:

1. **Stop using `.env.instance00`**
2. **Use `arari-app/.env.local` instead**
3. **Port Configuration**: All instances now use port 8000 consistently

## Configuration Comparison

### OLD (.env.instance00)
```env
INSTANCE_INDEX=00
PREFIX=arari_app
FRONTEND_PORT_HOST=4000
BACKEND_PORT_HOST=9000  ← OLD PORT
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:9000
```

### NEW (arari-app/.env.local)
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=development
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AUTH=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NOTIFICATIONS=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_TARGET_MARGIN=15
```

## Removal

This file can be safely deleted in future versions once all deployments have migrated to the new configuration structure.
